On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.
We have downloaded Titanic dataset from kaggle . Titanic Dataset consists of Test and Train data.
